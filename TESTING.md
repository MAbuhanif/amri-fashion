## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

On all pages, Lighthouse is flagging a warning 'Issues were logged in the Issues panel in Chrome Devtools'. This is caused by the built-in Stripe element, the image from home page, google font, fontawesom and CDN used by the site.

## Automated Testing

 - I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.
 - I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

- I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.
- In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python manage.py test name-of-app`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bag | tests.py | 74% | ![screenshot](documentation/coverage-testing/bag-test.png) |
| checkout | tests.py | 70% | ![screenshot](documentation/coverage-testing/checkout-test.png) |
| contact | tests.py | 96% | ![screenshot](documentation/coverage-testing/contact-test.png) |
| faq | tests.py | 98% | ![screenshot](documentation/coverage-testing/faq-test.png) |
| home | tests.py | 100% | ![screenshot](documentation/coverage-testing/home-test.png) |
